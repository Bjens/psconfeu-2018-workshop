# Update the help

Here is the best part: you can easily keep your help up-to-date with the changing code.

## Update markdown directly

If you just need to fix a typo or write a better description,
all you need to do is simply edit the markdown and re-generate the help.

Try it out.

```
New-ExternalHelp ...
Get-Help ...
```

## Add new parameter to the existing cmdlet

Let's add new parameter to the `New-Greeting` cmdlet.
For example, we can replace the hardcoded value of `"Hello"` for the greeting,
by a parameter value.

Edit the code in `.psm1`
Make a git commit (and include your .md files in it).

## Update the documentation

Re-load the module and run the command to update the markdown

```
Update-MarkdownHelp -Path ./docs
```

Take a look at the differences between the old .md file and the new one.

```
git diff
```

Notice the following differences:
- SYNTAX section got auto-updated
- New parameter section appeared and it has the `{{...}}` placeholder for description.
- **Question**: are there any other differences?

Check that attributes you put on the parameter in `psm1` file correspond to the new parameter yaml metadata.

## Add new cmdlet

Let's add new cmdlet `Get-Name` which will return a list of names that can be passed to the `New-Greeting`.
Use the same file `Greet.psm1`.
Come up with a couple parameters for it (maybe in different parameter sets?).
Now bootstrape the documentation for this parameter.

```
New-MarkdownHelp ...
```

## Check the help

Re-load the module and check that `Get-Name` got the help populated

```
Get-Help ...
```

Congratulations, you just learn how to update your help when it's out of date!
