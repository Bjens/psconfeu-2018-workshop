# Continuous integration

We all love automation.
Let's automatically enforce that our documentation shell always be up-to-date.

To achieve it, we will host repository on GitHub.
Then we will add free CI system AppVeyor to run some automation on all commits.

## Making a fork

1. Fork https://github.com/vors/psconfeu-2018-workshop to your github account.
2. Commit all your local work (`./docs` folder and changes in `.psm1` file) and push it to your fork.

*Note: if you need a refresher on using git and GitHub workflow, take  time to go thru [this 10 minutes tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). It will be important for the rest of the section*

Check out how your markdown documentation looks on the GitHub.
Send a pull request to one of the files in docs (could be a minor formatting change).
You can do it directly from the web UI - this is how people collaborating with you on the documentation will most likely do it.
Don't merge the pull request, keep it open.

## appveyor.yml

Sign-in on https://ci.appveyor.com/ with your GitHub account.

Click "+ New Project" and add CI integration for your fork of `psconfeu-2018-workshop`.

Edit `appveyor.yml` file.
In `build_script` add powershell snippet that creates external help in `en-US` folder.
In `test_script` add powershell snippet that will make sure that `Update-MarkdownHelp` doesn't change markdown.
This is an equivalent of markdown being up-to-date!

## Verify

Now push your changes for `appveyor.yml` to `master` branch.
Test the system by creating 2 pull requests:

1. One where you add a new parameter, but don't add appropriate documentation
2. Fix for the previous one where you add parameter and add the documentation for it.

**Congratulation, you just learn how to setup platyPS in CI pipeline!**
